        <div class="written"><span id="digimgc">JAVA is a high-level programming language that was first released in 1995. It is a class-based, object-oriented language designed to be simple, portable, and platform-independent. Java is commonly used for developing web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise software.One of the key features of Java is its "write once, run anywhere" principle, which means that Java code can be compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java a popular choice for developing cross-platform applications.Overall, Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that continues to be widely used in many industries and applications.</div>
